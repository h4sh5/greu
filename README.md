GRE Tunnel over UDP

Prerequisites for linux:

`apt install libevent-dev make -y`

To compile:

```
./configure
make
```

This program can act both as a server and as a client, and can establish ETH (tap) or IP (tun) links between unix machines. 
It doesn't work on OSX or Windows, due to the way it interacts with network drivers (tuntap).

It can create a VPN-like environment (without the "P") because there is no encryption. It's like a basic implementation of RFC 8086 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8086)
